<h1>Pig Game</h1>


Tutorial from Udemy course - [The complete Javscript course 2018](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)

It's a dice game made with Javascript where the goal is reach 100 points. The CSS part was already done; the goal was to learn new skills in Javascript and get stronger in already known skills.

This tutorial made me develop even more the <strong>DOM Manipulation</strong> skills and work more on <strong>functions</strong> and to write <em>DRY code</em>.
